  # Icons are inline SVG (VPFeature renders a string icon with v-html), drawn in the
  # logo's idiom: flat fills, no gradients, ink body with an #FF8700 accent. Colours come
  # from CSS custom properties so they invert with the theme — see theme/custom.css.

  # The TYPO3 logo, a trademark of the TYPO3 Association, used here to identify the CMS.
  # Path data and #FF8700 are verbatim from typo3/sysext/backend/Resources/Public/Images/
  # typo3_logo_orange.svg in TYPO3/typo3; the transform only centres and uniformly scales
  # it (source viewBox 43.201 42.122 83.098 84.172, centre 84.75/84.208) so it carries the
  # same optical weight as the drawn icons beside it. The mark itself is not altered.

## Install and ship

Three commands to install, four to deploy.

::: code-group

```bash [Homebrew]
brew tap ochorocho/shippy https://github.com/ochorocho/shippy
brew trust ochorocho/shippy
brew install shippy
```

```bash [Go]
go install github.com/ochorocho/shippy@latest
```

```bash [Docker]
docker run --rm ghcr.io/ochorocho/shippy:latest shippy --help
```

:::

```bash
shippy init                 # write .shippy.yaml from your composer.json
vim .shippy.yaml            # add hostname, remote_user, ssh_key
shippy config validate      # check syntax, fields and template variables
shippy deploy production    # ship it
```

## One file describes the whole deployment

No scripting DSL, no plugins — a host, the paths that must survive, and the commands to run before the
release goes live.

```yaml
hosts:
  production:
    hostname: www.example.com
    remote_user: deploy
    deploy_path: /var/www/{{name}}   # {{name}} comes from composer.json
    rsync_src: ./
    ssh_key: ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    keep_releases: 10                # ten releases to roll back to
    shared:                          # symlinked into every release
      - .env
      - var/log/
      - public/fileadmin/
      - public/uploads/

commands:
  - name: Clear TYPO3 cache
    run: ./{{config.bin-dir|vendor/bin}}/typo3 cache:flush

  - name: Database migrations
    run: ./{{config.bin-dir|vendor/bin}}/typo3 upgrade:run
```

## What it looks like on the server

The familiar Deployer/Capistrano layout — point your web server at `current/` and never touch it
again.

```
/var/www/myproject/
├── current -> releases/20240109120000    # Symlink to latest release
├── releases/
│   ├── 20240109120000/                   # Current release
│   ├── 20240109110000/                   # Previous release
│   └── 20240109100000/                   # Older release
└── shared/
    ├── .env                              # Shared files
    ├── var/
    │   ├── log/
    │   └── session/
    └── public/
        ├── fileadmin/
        └── uploads/
```

## Eight steps, and the site only moves at step seven

1. **Scan files** — walks the source directory, respecting `.gitignore` and your exclude patterns
2. **Connect to server** — establishes the SSH connection
3. **Create release** — a new timestamped directory, e.g. `releases/20260109203841`
4. **Sync files** — transfers everything into that release
5. **Create symlinks** — links the shared files and directories
6. **Execute commands** — cache flush, migrations, warmup — inside the new release
7. **Activate release** — atomically repoints `current`; the site goes live
8. **Cleanup** — removes old releases, keeps the last N

A failure in steps 1–6 never reaches production: the broken release is simply never activated.

## Ships from your pipeline too

::: code-group

```yaml [GitHub Actions]
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml

## Also in the box

- **`shippy backup`** — a ZIP with a database dump and your shared files, with TYPO3 credentials
  auto-detected and cache tables excluded
- **`shippy gitlab:upload`** — push that archive to the GitLab package registry straight from a
  scheduled pipeline
- **`shippy rollback -l`** — list every release with its date, git commit and tag before you choose
